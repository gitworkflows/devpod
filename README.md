[Devpod](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com)‚Äôs developer platform provides on-demand, pre-configured environments that automatically integrate into any tool, library, or dependency required for creating software. Devpod workspaces are the fastest and most secure way to ship software and are as easy as adding a `.devpod.yml` file to the root of any repository.

## Features

- **Dev environments as code** - Devpod is like infrastructure-as-code, but for your development environment. Devpod defines your editor extensions and requires dependencies in a declarative [`.devpod.yml` configuration](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/introduction/devpod-tutorial/2-configure-your-devpod-yml). Spinning up dev environments is easily repeatable and reproducible empowering you to automate, version-control, and share dev environments across your team.
- [**Prebuilt dev environments**](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) - Devpod continuously prebuilds all your git branches similar to a CI server. Control how Devpod pre-configures and initializes environments before you even start a workspace through tasks commands in your .devpod.yml. No more watching apt-get or npm install again.¬†
- [**Secure**](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/security) - Each Devpod workspace or prebuild runs on a secured single-use container providing fast startup times without compromising on security. Devpod generates SLSA level 1 compliant provenance. Devpod is also GDPR and SOC2 compliant. And, of course, Devpod is open-source and available for review by everyone.
- **Workspaces based on Docker** - Devpod instantly starts a container in the cloud based on an (optional) [Docker image](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/config-docker/). If you‚Äôre already using Docker, you can easily re-use your Docker file.¬†
- **GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket and Azure DevOps integration** - Devpod seamlessly [integrates](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/configure/authentication) into your workflow and works with all major Git hosting platforms including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps.
- **Integrated code reviews** - with Devpod you can do native code reviews on any PR/MR. No need to switch contexts anymore and clutter your local machine with your colleagues' PR/MR.
- **Collaboration** - invite team members to your dev environment or snapshot of any state of your dev environment to share it with your team asynchronously.
**Professional & customizable developer experience** - a Devpod workspace gives you the same capabilities as your Linux machine - pre-configured and optimized for your development workflow. Install any [VS Code extension](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions) with one click on a user and/or team level. You can also bring your [dotfiles](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles#dotfiles) and customize your dev environment as you like.


## Getting Started

- **Browser**:¬†
    - Using Devpod dashboard [devpod.khulnasoft.com/new](https://devpod.khulnasoft.com/new).
    - Add `devpod.khulnasoft.com/# `as a prefix to any of your GitHub/ GitLab/ Bitbucket repository, like [this](https://devpod.khulnasoft.com/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-typescript-react)
- **CLI**: You can also [install the Devpod CLI](https://www.devpod.khulnasoft.com/docs/references/devpod-cli#installation) and create your first workspace directly from your terminal :)
